  information_basis:
    primary_material:
      - "One-sentence description by an involved observer: 'A decision was made, but responsibility and communication are blurry, causing friction.'"
    secondary_material:
      - "Generic knowledge about team decisions in organisations (no specific documents)."
    assumptions_and_inferences:
      - "At least two actors/roles are involved (e.g. decision-maker and team)."
      - "Implementation details and follow-up responsibilities are not clearly allocated."
      - "Friction shows up as confusion, irritation or passive resistance."

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: >
      A decision has been taken in a team/organisation, but who is responsible
      for what and how it has been communicated remains unclear, which leads
      to friction and irritation among those affected.
    actors_and_roles:
      - label: "Decision-maker"
        role: "Formal leadership / project owner"
      - label: "Team / affected staff"
        role: "Implementers / people impacted by the decision"
    guiding_question: >
      How mature is the handling of responsibility and communication in this
      decision process, and does the resulting asymmetry count as functional
      or inadult?

  acrpd_profile:
    A_awareness: >
      Decision-maker appears aware that a decision is needed, but has limited
      awareness of how unclear responsibility and communication affect the team.
      Team is partially aware that something is expected, but not of precise roles
      and expectations.
    C_coherence: >
      There is a gap between the formal act of "decision taken" and the concrete
      follow-through (who does what, by when, with which mandate). Words and
      deeds are only partially aligned.
    R_responsibility: >
      Responsibility is blurred: the decision is centralised, but practical burden
      and unclear follow-up are pushed onto the team without explicit allocation
      or support.
    P_power_agency: >
      The decision-maker holds formal power, but uses it only to announce the
      decision, not to structure responsibilities. The team has limited agency:
      unclear room for initiative and no clear channel for questions or feedback.
    D_dignity_in_practice: >
      No direct humiliation, but low D1/D2 quality: people are left in uncertainty,
      which undercuts self-respect and relational respect (D-I/D-R) by not taking
      their need for clarity and fair responsibility-sharing seriously.

  acrpd_submodules_profile:
    A:
      A-I_inner_awareness: "Not assessed in detail in this short demo."
      A-R_role_awareness: >
        Decision-maker only partially reflects their role to give structure and
        clarity, not just decisions. Team role boundaries remain fuzzy.
      A-IM_impact_awareness: >
        Limited: the friction suggests the impact of unclear responsibility was
        underestimated.
      A-P_public_awareness: "Local/internal only; no wider public dimension considered."
    C:
      C-N_narrative_coherence: >
        Official story: 'Decision has been taken.' Missing: 'who, how, why, with
        which responsibilities.'
      C-S_social_coherence: >
        Team talk and leadership talk diverge: people experience confusion while
        leadership may perceive things as "settled."
    R:
      R-I_individual_responsibility: >
        Individual responsibilities are not clearly named; risk of implicit
        blame later.
      R-S_social_responsibility: >
        Burden is distributed diffusely over the team, which undermines fairness.
    P:
      P-I_inner_agency: >
        Some team members may still act proactively, but without a clear mandate
        this carries personal risk.
      P-S_social_agency: >
        Limited structured space for questions, negotiation or joint clarification.
    D:
      D-I_self_dignity_practice: >
        People may feel not properly taken seriously as responsible adults because
        they are left in the fog.
      D-R_relational_dignity: >
        Relationship strain: 'They decide, but we have to guess what they want.'
      D-P_public_symbolic_dignity: "No explicit public exposure; dignity strain is local and internal."

        - "Some adult elements: decision was taken, not endlessly postponed."
        - "Inadult zones: no clear translation into roles and tasks."
        - "Mixed coherence: the formal act exists, but practical follow-through is blurry."
    M_band:
      approx_range_0_to_10: [5, 7]
      justification_points:
        - "Decision-maker had clear power and alternatives: could have structured responsibilities."
        - "Predictability of friction was medium to high: unclear communication predictably creates confusion."
        - "No visible strong attempts at integration/repair yet (e.g. joint clarifying meeting)."
    IA_box:
      transparency:
        value: "unclear"
        justification: >
          People know that a decision exists, but do not clearly see the reasoning,
          responsibilities or expected actions.
      justification:
        value: "partial"
        justification: >
          The decision itself may be justified (e.g. necessary organisational step),
          but the way responsibility and communication are handled is not clearly justified.
      time_bound:
        value: "unclear"
        justification: >
          No explicit timeline or review point is mentioned; the unclear state might persist.
      reversibility:
        value: "partial"
        justification: >
          In principle, clarification is possible (meetings, mails), but no structured path
          for appeal or revision is visible yet.
      ia_summary_label: "IA_risk"
      ia_summary_comment: >
        At this point, the situation shows a clear risk of inadult asymmetry: power takes
        the decision, but does not take full responsibility for clarity and follow-through.
        With timely clarification, it can still be steered back into a functional asymmetry.

        A_band: [5, 7]

        description: >
          After some time, friction and confusion appear because nobody is sure who owns

        A_band: [4, 6]
        M_band: [5, 7]
    course_in_words: >
      The course moves from a formally clear but structurally incomplete decision (t0)
      towards increasing friction and role confusion (t1). If no clarification loop is
      opened, A may drift further down and IA_risk stabilises; if leadership uses the
      irritation as feedback and clarifies roles and communication, the trajectory can
      turn ascending.

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:
    open_questions:
      - "Was the decision content itself contested, or only the process?"
      - "How many concrete people are affected, and with which formal roles?"
      - "Did anyone explicitly request clarification, and how was this handled?"
    missing_data:
      - "Exact wording and channel of the original communication."
      - "Any written follow-up (emails, minutes, task lists)."
    distortion_risks:
      - "Observer perspective may sympathise more with the team than with leadership."
      - "Lack of concrete organisational context (size, culture, constraints)."

  analyst_reflection:
    self_implication: >
      As an analyst, I intuitively side with the wish for clarity and may
      underestimate structural constraints or time pressure on leadership.
      I also read the situation through a general scepticism towards 'decision by
      announcement' practices.
    possible_next_steps:
      - "Invite decision-maker and team to a short joint clarification session."
      - "Make responsibilities, timelines and decision-space explicit in writing."
      - "Agree on a review point to check whether friction decreases."

  uniform_report:
    summary_sentences:
      - >
        A decision has been taken, but responsibility and communication remain blurry,
        which predictably creates friction in the team.
      - >
        The A-score lies in a mixed band (4–6): some adult structure is present, but
        inadult elements dominate in the follow-through.
      - >
        The M-score for leadership lies in a medium-high band (5–7), as real power,
        alternatives and predictability existed but were not fully used for clarity.
      - >
        The IA-Box indicates an IA_risk: the asymmetry of decision power is not yet
        accompanied by matching responsibility for transparent communication and
        role allocation.
    key_findings:
      - "Strength: a decision was made instead of endless postponement."
      - "Weakness: responsibility and communication were not translated into concrete roles and tasks."
      - "A-band 4–6: mixed maturity under real conditions."
      - "M-band 5–7: leadership carries substantial structural responsibility for the friction."
      - "IA_box label: IA_risk due to partial transparency, weak time-bounding and only partial reversibility."
    trajectory_summary: >
      Without corrective steps, the pattern may solidify into a stable low-maturity
      practice; with a simple clarification loop, it can be shifted back towards
      functional asymmetry and higher maturity.
    conclusion_for_practice: >
      The quickest maturity gain lies in explicitly taking responsibility for the
      follow-through: clarify who owns which tasks, by when, with which mandate,
      and create a short feedback loop so that friction can be named and resolved.
