  uniform_report:
    title: "Praxeological analysis of public discourse event: Moralised public criticism"
    one_paragraph_overview: >
      This case examines moralised public criticism of a public figure under
      conditions of media amplification. The analysis focuses on how publicity
      restructures power, responsibility and reversibility, increasing asymmetry
      risks without resolving factual or ethical questions.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Publicity acts as a structural amplifier of asymmetry."
      - "Moral labels blur behaviour critique and person attribution."
      - "IA risks increase through lack of time-boundedness and reversibility."
      - "Precision limits shape confidence in A and M readings."
    maturity_summary: >
      In terms of maturity in practice, the enactments show mixed awareness and
      constrained responsibility under high-impact conditions.
    ia_box_summary: >
      The asymmetry is transparent but weakly justified and largely irreversible,
      indicating elevated IA risk in public discourse.
    trajectory_summary: >
      The trajectory shifts rapidly once criticism becomes amplified, reducing
      corrective options and stabilising moral frames.
    open_questions_summary: >
      It remains open how alternative framings would have altered the discourse
      and whether de-escalation mechanisms were available.
    conclusion: >
      The case illustrates that in high-publicity contexts, analytical precision
      and scope discipline are key structural levers to limit asymmetry and
      dignity risks without deciding substantive moral disputes.
