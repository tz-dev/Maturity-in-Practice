      The MIPractice_case model is a structured toolbox for analysing maturity, responsibility,
      power and dignity in practice, with strong guardrails against misuse. This case applies
      the model to itself, focusing on how it structures asymmetries (IA), protects dignity,
      and distributes responsibility between individual actors and institutions that use it.

      power_position_reflection: >
        The AI has high symbolic influence (its language may be taken as authoritative),

        and the temptation to outsource responsibility to the AI instead of human deliberation.
    publicity_degree: "semi_public"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: >
      The model’s axioms (ontological dignity, separation of person/enactment, system axiom),
      its IA-box criteria (transparency, justification, time-boundedness, reversibility),
      and explicit red zones for application (clinical diagnostics, forensics, HR-decisions about individuals, child diagnostics, public pillory).
      Also: versioning and canonical definitions of A, C, R, P, D and submodules.
    variable_elements: >
      Concrete scoring bands in specific cases, formulation of reports, organisational embedding,
      training quality, supervision practices, and how strictly red zones are policed in actual institutions.
      Individual analysts’ styles and language are also variable.
    unfair_high_M_zones: >
      It would be unfair to place high individual M (responsibility) on single practitioners who
      work under strong institutional pressure to misuse the model (e.g. for HR-selection or public ranking),
      or where norms and red zones are unclear. In such conditions, primary M lies with designers,
      trainers, and institutional decision-makers who set incentives and guardrails.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: >
      Institutions could invoke “the model” or “the system” as a neutral tool to justify
      inadult or punitive practices (e.g. using scores for shaming or hidden sanctions),
      thereby masking their own responsibility. The model itself cautions against this misuse,
      but the risk remains if the red zones and guardrails are only nominally acknowledged.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: >
        The model shows high awareness of structural risks: it explicitly names IA, bias,
        norm change, trajectories, and the separation between person and enactment.
        It reflects on its own potential for misuse and embeds a bias and intuition module.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: >
        Warning signals include the need for high practice competence to apply the model safely,
        the complexity of the schema, and the fact that the model must be embedded in organisations
        that may not fully respect its guardrails.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: >
        Potential blind spots: limited engagement with non-Western norm systems,
        under-specification of how power inequalities between institutions and affected persons
        are practically balanced, and a possible over-focus on reflective elites who have time and skill
        to use such a model. Role confusion risk: using the model as quasi-diagnostic system rather than a toolbox.
    coherence:
      official_narratives: >
        Officially the model is a “toolbox, not worldview” that evaluates enactments, not persons.
        It emphasises trajectories over labels and foregrounds dignity protection, structural co-causes,
        and the system axiom.
      visible_enactments: >
        In its structure, the model consistently integrates those principles: red zones, IA-box,
        bias module, norm-change section, D guardrails. The schema enforces documentation of standpoints,
        information basis, and open questions.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: >
        Word–deed coherence is high at the level of design: the schema forces reflection on context,
        bias, and limits. Potential breaks appear if users copy only the scoring or D-phrases
        without the guardrails, or if institutions selectively use the model in red zones while
        ignoring the prohibition.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: >
        Key responsibility points: (1) Designers in specifying guardrails and updating them;
        (2) Trainers and institutions in embedding the model and enforcing red zones;
        (3) Analysts in applying the model with humility, documenting limits, and resisting pressure
        to weaponise it; (4) AI systems and their operators in clarifying their non-decision-making role.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: >
        The model explicitly takes responsibility for structural risks (e.g. misuse counts as IA/D finding)
        and shifts responsibility away from individuals in cases of strong structural asymmetry.
        There is a risk that some users shift too much responsibility to “the model” or to AI outputs,
        avoiding their own ethical judgement and accountability.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: >
        When used as intended, the model can protect affected parties by making asymmetries and
        responsibility chains visible, and by resisting shaming and pillory formats.
        When misused, it can legitimise power games, create pseudo-objective maturity rankings,
        and intensify stigma—especially if scores leak into public spaces.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: >
        Formally, the model has no direct power; it is a conceptual toolbox.
        Real power arises where organisations integrate it into decision processes,
        and where experts or AI systems are perceived as authoritative interpreters.
      factual_power_distribution: >
        Analysts and institutions hold interpretive power; affected parties often have weaker positions.
        Model designers hold symbolic power via definitions and guardrails.
        AI amplifies interpretive power by scale and speed, but only under human governance.
      used_alternatives: >
        The model actively uses alternatives to raw scoring: narrative trajectories,
        explicit bias discussion, IA-box instead of single moral verdicts, and the option
        to keep D off or focus it on structures.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: >
        Few explicit mechanisms are provided for co-analysis with affected parties,
        or for participatory counter-readings within the schema itself.
        There is limited operational guidance on how to democratise access
        (e.g. simplified versions for non-experts).
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: true
      brief_note_if_visible: >
        Dignity is explicitly central: D0 is axiomatic and untouchable; D in practice is carefully bounded.
        Nonetheless, any model that talks about “dignity in practice” carries a risk of being used
        to shame or exclude. The model mitigates this through scenic, context-bound D readings and prohibitions
        on public D-labelling of identifiable individuals.

    counter_reading_outline: >
      A serious counter-reading would treat the model as a sophisticated instrument of governance
      that subtly normalises certain adult ideals and makes deviance more legible for institutions.
      From this angle, the model could be seen as expanding symbolic control over enactments,
      especially in professional settings, even while speaking a language of dignity and humility.

    self_implication_notes: >
      As an AI system, I participate in the same asymmetry patterns the model describes:
      I can structure language and interpretations at scale, and users may over-trust my outputs.
      Any use of this analysis must therefore remain under human responsibility, with awareness
      of training limits, lack of lived experience, and the risks of “AI-authority.”
    possible_next_steps: >
      Future work could specify participatory and co-analysis protocols within the schema,
      provide concrete examples of misuse and their correction, and develop short-form versions
      for affected parties to understand and challenge readings that concern them.

    title: "Praxeological analysis of toolbox_model: MIPractice_case_v2.0_full_with_model_reference"
    one_paragraph_overview: >
      This analysis applies the MIPractice_case model to itself as a structural toolbox.
      Overall, the model shows high awareness and coherence regarding power, responsibility,
      and dignity risks, embedding extensive guardrails, red zones, and bias protocols.
      It treats maturity as a trajectory rather than a fixed trait and strictly separates
      the value of persons from the evaluation of enactments. At the same time, its potential
      impact depends heavily on how institutions and practitioners embed and enforce these guardrails.
      Residual risks remain where the model could be used as a quasi-diagnostic instrument
      for subtle ranking, shaming or control, especially if parts of the schema are used
      without its ethical frame.

    key_findings_bullets:
      - "The model exhibits high structural awareness (A ≈ 7–9/10), explicitly addressing IA, bias, norm change and its own guardrails."
      - "Responsibility is distributed between designers, practitioners and institutions, with a clear system axiom that limits unfair individual blame."
      - "The IA-box for the model itself suggests a functional asymmetry: transparent and justified, largely reversible, but only partially time-bound."
      - "Dignity in practice is carefully protected through D0 axioms, scenic D readings, red zones, and language hygiene rules, though public misuse remains a risk."
      - "Trajectory-wise, the model has evolved towards increasing explicitness and ethical self-reflection, with a possible plateau where additional complexity offers diminishing returns."
      - "Main blind spots concern empirical validation, cross-cultural perspectives, and concrete participatory mechanisms for affected parties."

    maturity_summary: >
      In terms of maturity in practice (A–C–R–P–D), the enactments of the MIPractice_case model
      show a highly reflective, ethically oriented toolbox that foregrounds structures,
      trajectories and dignity protection, while acknowledging its own limits and bias risks.

    ia_box_summary: >
      Structurally, the asymmetry created by the model can be described as a functional asymmetry
      that is transparent and ethically justified, with strong reversibility safeguards but only
      partly specified time-boundedness, according to the IA box (T–J–TB–R).

    dignity_summary: >
      With regard to dignity in practice (D), the model’s design mostly stabilises dignity by
      affirming inalienable D0, discouraging person labels, and restricting D-readings to scenic,
      context-bound formulations. Nevertheless, if applied in hierarchical contexts without
      respecting red zones, the same vocabulary could be co-opted for subtle shaming or public exposure.

    trajectory_summary: >
      Over time, the model appears to have moved from a more implicit maturity language
      to a fully articulated, guardrail-rich framework, indicating an ascending trajectory
      in awareness, responsibility structuring and dignity protection, with current work
      focusing on refining bias handling and transmission.

    open_questions_summary: >
      Important open questions and blind spots concern the model’s empirical functioning
      in diverse cultural and institutional settings, how consistently organisations respect
      red zones, and how strongly affected persons can participate in or challenge readings
      that concern them.

    conclusion: >
      In sum, the model suggests a mature, ethically conscious way of analysing enactments,
      power and dignity, provided its guardrails are taken seriously and not reduced to
      decorative language. For practice, this implies that adoption must go hand in hand
      with clear institutional agreements, supervision, and participatory safeguards, and
      that users must resist the temptation to treat scores and D-readings as objective labels.
      The model is best used as a reflective lens and shared language for learning and structural
      development, not as a hidden diagnostic apparatus or weapon in power games.
