  uniform_report:
    title: "Praxeological analysis of process: Blurry responsibility after a decision"
    one_paragraph_overview: >
      This case analyses an organisational process where a formal decision is
      followed by diffuse responsibility for communication and implementation.
      While awareness and authority are present at the decision point, the lack
      of explicit ownership creates downstream asymmetries and coordination
      problems.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Clear decision does not equal clear responsibility."
      - "Awareness remains relatively high, while maturity declines through diffusion."
      - "Asymmetry is not illegitimate per se, but becomes problematic over time."
      - "Structural levers exist to restore clarity."
    maturity_summary: >
      In terms of maturity in practice, the case shows an initial adult enactment
      that degrades into mixed maturity due to missing responsibility assignment.
    ia_box_summary: >
      The asymmetry lacks justification and time-boundedness, qualifying as an
      inadult asymmetry that remains reversible.
    trajectory_summary: >
      Over time, the case moves from a high-maturity decision moment to a lower
      maturity implementation phase marked by responsibility drift.
    open_questions_summary: >
      It remains unclear whether the diffusion was intentional, contested, or a
      recurring organisational pattern.
    conclusion: >
      The model highlights that organisational maturity depends less on decision
      quality alone than on sustained responsibility clarity across time.
