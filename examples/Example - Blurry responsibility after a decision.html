          <h2>Case snapshot</h2>
          <p>
            A decision in a team or organisation has been taken, but it remains unclear who is responsible
            for which aspects of implementation and how the decision has been communicated. This lack of
            clarity produces friction, irritation and informal conflict among those affected.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Guiding question:</strong><br/>
            How mature is the handling of responsibility and communication in this decision process,
            and does the resulting asymmetry count as functional or inadult?
          </p>
          <p><strong>Actors (roles only):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Formal decision maker / decision body</strong> – Initiates, authorises or signs off the decision.</li>
            <li><strong>Middle management / team leads</strong> – Translate the decision into local practice and distribute tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Team members / staff</strong> – Implement the decision in everyday work and live with its consequences.</li>
            <li><strong>Informal communication hubs</strong> – Spread information, interpretations and rumours across the team.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- MAIN ROW: ACRPD + IA-BOX -->
        <div class="section-row">
          <!-- LEFT: ACRPD -->
          <div class="section">
            <h2>ACRPD – structural reading</h2>
            <p><strong>A – Awareness</strong><br/>
              Decision makers appear to have at least some awareness of the need to decide, but there is
              limited awareness of how unclear responsibility and communication will impact those affected.
              Awareness of downstream friction and implementation complexity seems underdeveloped. Early
              irritation, repeated questions about &quot;who does what,&quot; and informal complaints are clear
              warning signals that responsibility and communication were not sufficiently clarified. There is
              likely confusion about who owns implementation, who answers questions, and who carries
              consequences if things go wrong; some actors may assume &quot;leadership owns it,&quot; while leadership
              informally expects &quot;the team will sort it out.&quot;
            </p>
            <p><strong>C – Coherence</strong><br/>
              Officially, the narrative may sound like: &quot;We decided X together&quot; or &quot;The organisation has
              decided X for good reasons,&quot; suggesting collective orientation and rational decision making.
              In practice, enactments show a gap: communication is patchy or delayed, roles are not spelled
              out, and different sub-groups receive different messages. Friction and irritation become
              everyday signals of this incoherence. There is a notable coherence break between the claim of
              a clear and legitimate decision and the messy, unclear responsibility structure that follows:
              the decision is treated as finished while the communicative and role work is not.
            </p>
            <p><strong>R – Responsibility</strong><br/>
              Prior to taking the decision, actors could have clarified who decides, who implements, who
              communicates, and who monitors impact. After the decision, key responsibility points include
              naming owners, defining communication channels, and creating feedback loops for those
              affected. Responsibility appears partially diffused: leadership may see their task as &quot;having
              decided,&quot; while teams feel left with unstructured fallout. Some actors may over-assume
              responsibility informally (trying to fix everything), others under-assume (waiting passively or
              blaming &quot;the organisation&quot;). Those affected face uncertainty, duplicated efforts, missed tasks,
              and possible conflicts; third parties (e.g. customers, partner units) may experience delays
              or inconsistent behaviour because no one clearly owns communication and follow-up.
            </p>
            <p><strong>P – Power / agency</strong><br/>
              Formal decisional power lies with leadership or a designated decision body, controlling agenda,
              timing and official wording of the decision. Informally, middle management and key
              communicators hold factual power: they decide what gets passed on, how, and with which
              emphasis. Staff have little power to change the decision but do have power to slow down
              implementation or to raise resistance. The chosen path used formal decision power but only
              partially used available alternatives such as co-designing the communication plan, staging a
              Q&amp;A, or naming explicit owners and escalation paths. Alternatives such as involving
              representatives of those affected earlier, piloting the decision, or clearly documenting who is
              responsible for what were not fully used or were considered too time-consuming in the short term.
            </p>
            <p><strong>D – Dignity in practice (short)</strong><br/>
              While dignity is not explicitly attacked, irritation and friction can undermine everyday
              self-respect and relational dignity (D1/D2) if people feel blamed for unclear expectations or
              are left alone with contradictory messages.
            </p>

            <div class="ia-grid">
              <div class="ia-chip">
                <strong>T · Transparency</strong>
                Those affected experience opacity regarding who is responsible for what and where to address
                questions or concerns. The structure of responsibility is not transparent.
              </div>
              <div class="ia-chip">
                <strong>J · Justification</strong>
                The existence of a decision and some hierarchy-based asymmetry can be justified by organisational
                needs and protected goods (coordination, strategy, efficiency), even if the process is imperfect.

              <div class="ia-chip">
                <strong>TB · Time-bound</strong>
                It is unclear whether the current blurry phase is explicitly time-limited (e.g. until a follow-up
                meeting) or whether it drifts into a semi-permanent state of confusion.
              </div>
              <div class="ia-chip">
                <strong>R · Reversibility</strong>
                The asymmetry and its effects are, in principle, reversible: roles can be clarified, communication
                can be repeated, and responsibility can be re-assigned more clearly, if actors decide to do so.

              <strong>IA summary:</strong><br/>
              Overall, the IA-Box points to an <em>IA_risk</em>: the asymmetry of decision power is justified and
              reversible, but low transparency and unclear time-boundedness create a non-trivial risk that
              inadult patterns (blame, avoidance, chronic ambiguity) stabilise if no structural clarification follows.

            <strong>Conclusion for practice</strong><br/>
            In sum, the model suggests that the handling of responsibility and communication in this decision
            process is structurally improvable rather than fundamentally toxic. For practice, this implies
            that decision-making should be coupled with explicit ownership mapping, a simple communication
            plan, and clear feedback channels. Focusing on structures and processes—rather than blaming
            individuals—can turn the current irritation into a starting point for more mature, transparent
            and dignity-preserving decision cultures.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Trajectory hint</strong><br/>
            Over time, the case can either move towards higher maturity if the confusion is named and roles
            are clarified, or slide into a plateau of normalised irritation if ambiguity remains unaddressed.
