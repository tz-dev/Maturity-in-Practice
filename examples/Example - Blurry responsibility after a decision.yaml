    analyst_role:
      description: >
        External reflective observer (here: AI assistant) helping to structure the reading of
        responsibility, communication and asymmetry without making binding judgements about individuals.
      power_position_reflection: >
        The analysis has interpretive influence but no direct enforcement power. There is a risk
        that its language may be taken as more objective than it is; responsibility for decisions
        remains with human actors in the organisation.
    publicity_degree: "institutional"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: >
      The decision has already been taken and sets a binding frame for certain tasks, priorities or
      resource allocations. Organisational rules, legal requirements, and existing hierarchies form
      additional frame conditions that individual actors cannot easily change.
    variable_elements: >
      How clearly roles and responsibilities are defined; how the decision is communicated
      (timing, channels, space for questions); whether ambiguity is named and clarified; and how
      feedback from those affected is handled. These are open to improvement without changing
      the decision content itself.
    unfair_high_M_zones: >
      It would be unfair to place high individual responsibility (M) on staff members for confusion,
      delay or friction if they never received a clear assignment or explanation. Primary M should
      not rest on those who were structurally excluded from the decision or information flows.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: >
      Decision makers could misuse the ambiguity by claiming "the team should just take ownership"
      while having failed to define ownership structurally. Conversely, middle management might
      hide behind "the decision came from above" to avoid clarifying roles with their teams.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: >
        Decision makers appear to have at least some awareness of the need to decide, but there is
        limited awareness of how unclear responsibility and communication will impact those affected.
        Awareness of downstream friction and implementation complexity seems underdeveloped.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: >
        Early irritation, repeated questions about "who does what," and informal complaints are clear
        warning signals that responsibility and communication were not sufficiently clarified.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: >
        There is likely confusion about who owns implementation, who answers questions, and who
        carries consequences if things go wrong. Some actors may assume "leadership owns it,"
        while leadership informally expects "the team will sort it out."
    coherence:
      official_narratives: >
        Officially, the narrative may sound like: "We decided X together" or "The organisation has
        decided X for good reasons." It suggests collective orientation and rational decision making.
      visible_enactments: >
        In practice, enactments show a gap: communication is patchy or delayed, roles are not spelled
        out, and different sub-groups receive different messages. Friction and irritation become
        everyday signals of this incoherence.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: >
        There is a notable coherence break between the claim of a clear and legitimate decision and
        the messy, unclear responsibility structure that follows. The decision is treated as finished,
        while the communicative and role work is not.
    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: >
        Prior to taking the decision, actors could have clarified: who decides, who implements,
        who communicates, and who monitors impact. After the decision, key responsibility points
        include: naming owners, defining communication channels, and creating feedback loops for
        those affected.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: >
        Responsibility appears partially diffused: leadership may see their task as "having decided,"
        while teams feel left with unstructured fallout. Some actors may over-assume responsibility
        informally (trying to fix everything), others under-assume (waiting passively or blaming
        "the organisation").
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: >
        Those affected face uncertainty, duplicated efforts, missed tasks, and possible conflicts.
        Third parties (e.g. customers, partner units) may experience delays or inconsistent behaviour
        because no one clearly owns communication and follow-up.
    power:
      formal_power_distribution: >
        Formal decisional power lies with leadership or a designated decision body. They control the
        agenda, timing and official wording of the decision.
      factual_power_distribution: >
        Informally, middle management and key communicators hold factual power: they decide what
        gets passed on, how, and with which emphasis. Staff have little power to change the decision
        but power to slow down implementation or to raise resistance.
      used_alternatives: >
        The chosen path used formal decision power but only partially used available alternatives
        such as: co-designing the communication plan, staging a Q&A, or naming explicit owners
        and escalation paths.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: >
        Alternatives such as involving representatives of those affected earlier, piloting the decision,
        or clearly documenting who is responsible for what were not fully used or were considered
        too time-consuming in the short term.
    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: false
      brief_note_if_visible: >
        While dignity is not explicitly attacked, irritation and friction can undermine everyday
        self-respect and relational dignity (D1/D2) if people feel blamed for unclear expectations
        or are left alone with contradictory messages.

        justification: >
          Those affected experience opacity regarding who is responsible for what and where to address
          questions or concerns. The structure of responsibility is not transparent.
      justified:
        fulfilled: true
        justification: >
          The existence of a decision and some hierarchy-based asymmetry can be justified by organisational

          It is unclear whether the current blurry phase is explicitly time-limited (e.g. until a follow-up
          meeting) or whether it drifts into a semi-permanent state of confusion.
      reversible:
        fulfilled: true
        justification: >
          The asymmetry and its effects are, in principle, reversible: roles can be clarified, communication
          can be repeated, and responsibility can be re-assigned more clearly, if actors decide to do so.

  ia_protection:
    transparency_measures: >
      At present, IA protection is weak: transparency about who owns which part of the decision and

    time_bound_measures: >
      No explicit sunset clauses or review dates are mentioned. A review point could be set to assess
      implementation and clarify roles.
    reversibility_measures: >
      The organisation could revise communication, name owners, and document responsibilities.
      Complaint or feedback channels could be made explicit to reverse confusion effects.
    participation_of_affected:
      level: "consulted"
      examples: >
        Those affected might be asked for feedback informally, but structured co-design of the decision

        M_band_at_t: "≈ 5–7/10"
    course_in_words: >
      The trajectory initially shows a formally led decision with incomplete structural follow-through.
      As implementation begins, blurred responsibility produces friction and erodes trust. A later
      clarification step could turn this into a learning experience (ascending trajectory), while
      persistent ambiguity risks stabilising a plateau of chronic irritation and IA risk.
    responsibility_viability_range: >
      Viable responsibility is highest for those who shaped and communicated the decision, and lower
      for staff who were structurally dependent on clear instructions. Over-assigning M to staff in
      this setting would be structurally unfair.

      A counter-reading might argue that the decision process was as clear as reasonably possible

      the responsibility structure is actually adequate but perceived as unclear by a subset of actors.

  uniform_report:
    title: "Praxeological analysis of decision_process: blurry_responsibility_after_a_team_or_organisational_decision"
    one_paragraph_overview: >
      This analysis examines a decision process in which the content of the decision is set, but
      responsibility for implementation and communication remains blurry. The situation shows a
      medium level of maturity: formal decision power is exercised, yet structural follow-through
      on role clarity and communication is underdeveloped. Those affected experience friction and
      irritation because they do not know who owns what, which questions can be raised where, and
      who carries consequences for outcomes. The model highlights this not as a malicious set-up
      but as a structurally risky handling of responsibility that can be improved through clearer
      ownership and communication design.

    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Maturity in practice is mixed (A ≈ 4–6/10): the decision is taken, but awareness of downstream effects and role clarity is limited."
      - "Responsibility concentrates structurally with decision owners and process leaders (M ≈ 5–7/10), not with staff who are left with unclear expectations."
      - "The IA-box indicates an IA risk: justification for the asymmetry is plausible, reversibility is possible, but transparency is low and time-boundedness is unclear."
      - "Friction and irritation signal a dignity-relevant strain for those affected, even though the D-module remains deactivated in this reading."
      - "The future trajectory depends on whether the organisation uses the irritation as a learning impulse to clarify roles or normalises chronic ambiguity."

    maturity_summary: >
      In terms of maturity in practice (A–C–R–P–D), the decision process shows a solid but incomplete
      handling of responsibility and communication: the decision itself is taken, yet structural clarity
      about who owns which part of implementation and communication is missing, leading to recurrent
      ambiguity and irritation.

    ia_box_summary: >
      Structurally, the resulting asymmetry can be described as an IA risk rather than a fully
      inadulte asymmetry: decision power and justification are acceptable, and the situation is reversible,
      but low transparency and unclear time limits create a non-trivial risk of inadult dynamics.

    dignity_summary: ""  # left empty because D_activated == false

    trajectory_summary: >
      Over time, the case can either move towards higher maturity if the confusion is named and roles
      are clarified, or slide into a plateau of normalised irritation if ambiguity remains unaddressed.

    open_questions_summary: >
      Important open questions concern how different actor groups perceive the situation, how high the
      stakes of the decision are, and whether leadership is aware of and responsive to the friction
      generated by blurry responsibility.

    conclusion: >
      In sum, the model suggests that the handling of responsibility and communication in this decision
      process is structurally improvable rather than fundamentally toxic. For practice, this implies
      that decision-making should be coupled with explicit ownership mapping, a simple communication
      plan, and clear feedback channels. Focusing on structures and processes—rather than blaming
      individuals—can turn the current irritation into a starting point for more mature, transparent
      and dignity-preserving decision cultures.
