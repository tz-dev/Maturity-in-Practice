      The bonsai thesis: an argument claiming that the practice of cultivating bonsai —
      shaping, restricting and aesthetically curating small trees — may express a deeper flaw
      in the associated philosophical framework: a tendency to deform or constrain living beings
      (plants, self, others) according to human ideals.
    secondary_material: >
      General cultural knowledge about bonsai tradition, aesthetic shaping practices,
      symbolic interpretations, and discourses around human–nature relationships.
    assumptions_and_inferences: >
      The analysis assumes the thesis is not attacking individuals but interpreting a practice.
      It infers broader relational themes: shaping, restriction, aestheticisation,
      and the ethical symbolism of controlling growth.

  snapshot:
    short_case_description: >
      The bonsai thesis interprets the aesthetic practice of shaping miniature trees as
      a sign of deeper philosophical or relational tendencies: imposing human ideals,
      restricting natural growth, and symbolically mirroring problematic ways of treating
      oneself and others. The analysis asks what maturity and dignity patterns become
      visible both in the practice criticised and in the manner of critique.

    publicity_degree: "public"

  frame_vs_variability:
    frame_elements: >
      Bonsai as a cultural–aesthetic practice with long-standing techniques, traditions, and
      philosophies. Structural asymmetry: humans shape plants, not vice versa.
    variable_elements: >
      The interpretive stance toward bonsai (reverence, critique, aesthetic focus),
      levels of control applied, symbolic meanings attributed by practitioners or critics.
    unfair_high_M_zones: >
      It would be unfair to attribute high moral responsibility (M) to bonsai practitioners
      for symbolic interpretations they did not intend. Responsibility lies more with the
      interpretive frame than with individuals.
    misuse_of_system_as_excuse: >
      A critique could misuse the symbolic reading to shame cultural practices or claim
      philosophical superiority; conversely, defenders may dismiss critique as ignorance.

  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:
      real_knowledge_t: >
        The thesis shows awareness of relational dynamics in human–nature interactions:
        shaping, constraining, ideal projection, aestheticising.
      warning_signals_or_alt_info: >
        Bonsai also expresses care, patience and co-creation; the shaping is not necessarily
        domination but a dialogue between gardener and plant.
      presumed_blind_spots_or_role_confusion: >
        Possible conflation of symbolic interpretation with practitioners’ actual intentions;
        risk of overextending the metaphor to human self/other relationships.

    coherence:
      official_narratives: >
        Bonsai philosophy highlights harmony, patience, attentiveness and respect for form.
      visible_enactments: >
        Practices include pruning, wiring and shaping — real interventions that limit natural growth.
      word_deed_coherence_or_breaks: >
        There is a tension: declared harmony vs. real constraint. But many aesthetic practices
        involve similar tensions; critique may selectively highlight the constraint side.

    responsibility:
      central_responsibility_points: >
        Responsibility lies in how humans choose to interpret and enact shaping practices.
        Practitioners carry responsibility for their treatment of living beings;
        critics carry responsibility for fair and contextual reading.
      patterns_of_taking_shifting_refusing: >
        The thesis takes responsibility by challenging philosophical blind spots.
        Possible risk: shifting responsibility onto an entire culture or aesthetic tradition.
      consequences_for_affected_and_third_parties: >
        For plants: restricted growth but careful care.
        For practitioners: potential moralisation of their cultural practice.
        For broader audiences: helpful ethical reflection on human–nature relations.

    power:
      formal_power_distribution: >
        Humans exert full physical power over bonsai; plants cannot resist shaping.
      factual_power_distribution: >
        Practitioners choose the degree of restraint; critics choose interpretive framing
        that shapes public meaning.
      used_alternatives: >
        The thesis uses symbolic interpretation rather than moral accusation; invites reflection.
      unused_or_blocked_alternatives: >
        Limited attention to positive relational aspects (care, co-creation) in the thesis as presented.

    dignity_practice:
      is_D_module_activated: true
      brief_note_if_visible: >
        The case involves relational dignity toward non-human beings and symbolic dignity toward
        human self/other relations. The thesis suggests that certain shaping practices may mirror
        inadult tendencies toward controlling or idealising relational partners.

  uniform_report:
    title: "Praxeological analysis of thesis: bonsai_thesis"
    one_paragraph_overview: >
      The bonsai thesis critiques the aesthetic shaping of bonsai as a symbolic expression of
      human tendencies to constrain living beings according to ideal forms. The analysis finds
      moderate awareness and coherence in linking shaping and relational maturity, while noting
      cultural nuance gaps and risks of overgeneralisation. Dignity themes emerge around control,
      relational handling and symbolic self-treatment. Overall, the thesis opens productive ethical
      reflection without constituting a moral verdict.

    key_findings_bullets:
      - "A moderate A-band (≈5–7) reflects symbolic insight but limited cultural nuance."
      - "Responsibility is shared between practitioner enactments and interpretive framing."
      - "IA analysis suggests symbolic asymmetry rather than inadult exploitation."
      - "Dignity tensions appear mainly as metaphors for human relational patterns."
      - "Counter-readings show that shaping can also be interpreted as care, not control."

    maturity_summary: >
      The thesis’ enactments show moderate maturity—reflective, ethically motivated, but with
      interpretive blind spots and an ambivalent dignity stance.

    ia_box_summary: >
      Structural asymmetry is symbolic and largely reversible: the critique does not impose
      coercive interpretations and remains contestable.

    dignity_summary: >
      Dignity in practice appears ambivalent: the thesis highlights potential dignity tensions
      in shaping practices but may inadvertently reduce the dignity of practitioners if framed
      moralistically.

    trajectory_summary: >
      The interpretation evolves from aesthetic practice toward ethical reflection, increasing
      awareness while leaving cultural nuance partially underdeveloped.

    open_questions_summary: >
      Key blind spots include practitioner perspectives, cultural context and alternative
      interpretations of shaping.

    conclusion: >
      The bonsai thesis is a productive reflective lens on relational maturity, but its ethical
      force depends on maintaining contextual humility and avoiding cultural moralisation.
