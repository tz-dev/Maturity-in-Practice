  uniform_report:
    title: "Praxeological self-analysis of MIPractice"
    one_paragraph_overview: >
      This self-application reads MIPractice as an analysis artifact and governance
      tool. It evaluates clarity, guardrails, reversibility, and transmission
      safety rather than any substantive case outcome.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "High awareness and coherence with explicit guardrails."
      - "Reversibility and dignity protection are structurally embedded."
      - "Primary risks lie in complexity and scaling."
      - "AH Precision effectively exposes residual attack surfaces."
    maturity_summary: >
      The model exhibits high maturity in practice as a framework, with remaining
      risks concentrated in adoption and governance rather than design.
    ia_box_summary: >
      Asymmetry is functional and justified, with strong transparency and
      reversibility; time-bounded governance remains optional.
    trajectory_summary: >
      Maturity remains high if scaling is paired with training and review gates.
    open_questions_summary: >
      Evidence from longitudinal use will further test robustness.
    conclusion: >
      MIPractice is structurally critique-ready and dignity-protective; continued
      hardening should focus on onboarding and governance at scale.
