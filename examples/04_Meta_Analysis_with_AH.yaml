  acrpd_profile:
    awareness:

        The artifact shows awareness of the topic area, but it is unclear which
        parts are evidence-based vs. interpretive synthesis.

        Missing explicit uncertainty statements suggests a risk of over-closure.

      The key shift is from “analysis draft” to “decision proxy”. M increases when

  open_questions_and_blind_spots:

      Whether the artifact’s key claims are supported by direct evidence or
      interpretive synthesis; whether dissenting views were considered.
    missing_data_or_perspectives: >
      Underlying source documents; affected-party perspectives; commissioning
      constraints and incentives.
    distortion_risks: >
      Authority bias, framing bias, and selection bias if the artifact is treated
      as “the evidence” rather than “an interpretation”.

  biases_case_level:
    initial_intuition: >
      The artifact looks coherent and well-intentioned, but risks over-closure if
      it does not make thresholds and reversibility explicit.
    named_bias_risks:
      - "document_authority_bias"
      - "framing_bias"
      - "selection_bias"
    counter_reading_outline: >
      A plausible counter-reading is that the artifact’s recommendations are
      directionally sound but prematurely specific given missing case data; a
      governance-safe version would be staged and conditional.

  transmission_check:
    ready_for_structural_decisions: false
    reasons_if_not: >
      Not ready without explicit thresholds and a formal review/correction loop;
      otherwise it risks becoming a binding proxy under institutional pressure.

  uniform_report:
    title: "Praxeological analysis of analysis_artifact: Report / memo / commentary (meta object)"
    one_paragraph_overview: >
      This meta case treats an existing report as an analysis artifact and checks
      its precision, scope discipline, evidence linking, reversibility and
      governance readiness. The goal is not to decide whether the report’s
      substantive conclusion is correct, but whether the artifact is safe to
      transmit into decisions under institutional pressure.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Coherent narrative can mask missing thresholds between analysis and recommendations."
      - "Transmission turns the artifact into a decision proxy, raising responsibility stakes."
      - "Reversibility and time-boundedness must be made explicit to avoid lock-in."
      - "AH Precision is primary: attack points and hardening steps are concrete and minimal."
    maturity_summary: >
      In terms of maturity in practice, the artifact shows high competence in
      presentation, with remaining maturity risks concentrated in governance
      interface design (thresholds, review, correction paths).
    ia_box_summary: >
      The main asymmetry risk stems from institutional transmission pressure: if
      inference steps, review windows and correction paths are not explicit,
      the artifact becomes hard to justify and hard to reverse.
    trajectory_summary: >
      Once the artifact is cited as a basis for action, responsibility and
      asymmetry risks rise; adding decision gates can restore an iterative path.
    open_questions_summary: >
      Key open questions concern the completeness of the evidence base, whether
      dissenting perspectives were integrated, and how the artifact will be used
      in governance.
    conclusion: >
      The model suggests treating the artifact as a versioned, conditional input
      with explicit thresholds, review timing and correction channels, so that it
      remains critique-ready rather than becoming an irreversible proxy.
