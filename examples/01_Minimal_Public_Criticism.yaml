    title: "Praxeological analysis of scene: Public criticism in a team meeting"
    one_paragraph_overview: >
      This example examines a single feedback interaction in a team meeting where
      a manager publicly criticises a team member. The focus lies on how awareness,
      responsibility and power interact in a semi-public organisational setting.
      The situation contains a clear decision point with available alternatives,
      making it suitable for illustrating maturity in practice without judging
      persons.
    key_findings_bullets:
      - "Moderate awareness with a blind spot regarding public impact."
      - "Legitimate hierarchy combined with an avoidable exposure risk."
      - "Asymmetry shows a manageable IA risk rather than a clear violation."
      - "Trajectory depends on whether a corrective follow-up occurs."
    maturity_summary: >
      In terms of maturity in practice, the enactment is mixed and situational,
      not fixed, with room for improvement through context-sensitive choices.
    ia_box_summary: >
      Structurally, the asymmetry is transparent and reversible, but only partially
      justified in its public form, indicating an IA risk.
    trajectory_summary: >
      The case shifts from a neutral baseline to a tension point at the moment of
      public criticism, with a potential recovery path through private clarification.
    open_questions_summary: >
      It remains open how the criticised person experienced the feedback and
      whether similar patterns occur repeatedly.
    conclusion: >
      As a minimal entry case, this scene demonstrates how small choices in power
      use and context can shift maturity trajectories without invoking deeper
      diagnostic or dignity modules.
