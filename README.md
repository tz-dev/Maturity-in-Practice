# Maturity in Practice – IA Model Specification  
### A praxeological framework for maturity, responsibility, asymmetry & dignity in practice  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** T. Zöller  
**Status:** Public model specification

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains the **official model specification** for  
**Maturity in Practice / IA (inadulte asymmetry)** — a praxeological framework
for analysing enactments, responsibility, asymmetry and dignity in practice.

It includes:

- **Maturity in Practice – Model Specification.html**  
  Human-readable specification of the ACRPD model, IA-box, dignity framework,  
  bias/intuition/norm-change modules, axioms, formal notation and the case schema.

- **Maturity in Practice – Model Specification.pdf**  
  Print- and citation-ready version of the model specification.

- **MIPractice_case_v2.0_full_with_model_reference.yaml**  
  The *canonical* machine-readable description of the model.  
  This YAML file contains:
  - the complete normative model (`model_reference`)
  - the full case schema (`case`)
  - guardrails, axioms, scoring rules, submodule matrix (2.4), IA-box logic,
    bias/intuition/norm-change modules, trajectory patterns, formal notation.

Together, these files define the authoritative public specification of the IA / ACRPD model.

## 🧩 What this repository provides

- A complete and citable **model definition**  
  (parameters A–C–R–P–D, submodules, IA-box, dignity framework, axioms)

- A **uniform case schema** for conducting structured analyses  
  with guardrails, A/M bands, IA evaluation, trajectory, and optional D-module

- A **machine-interpretable YAML schema** serving as a  
  *single source of truth* for implementations, training pipelines, audits and research tools

- A **formal notation layer** allowing interoperability with  
  governance systems, psychology/sociology tools, and AI reasoning engines

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository aims to:

1. Provide a stable **reference architecture** for praxeological analysis  
   (maturity, asymmetry, responsibility, dignity in practice)

2. Ensure transparent, ethical and critique-ready use of the model  
   in coaching, organisations, teams, public institutions, and research

3. Enable reproducible, safe integration into **AI systems**  
   as a governance and reasoning layer

4. Offer a fully documented structure for **teaching and academic work**

## 🚀 Using the YAML specification

The YAML file  
**`MIPractice_case_v2.0_full_with_model_reference.yaml`**  
is the *single source of truth* and should be consumed directly.

Typical use cases:

- Schema validation of case analyses  
- Automated generation of ACRPD profiles or uniform reports  
- Integration into LLM reasoning chains  
- Training, audit and supervision workflows  
- Research requiring structured evaluation frameworks

Do **not** rewrite or partially replicate the YAML; instead, import it.

## 🧭 Versioning

This repository follows semantic versioning for the YAML schema:

- `model_reference` and `case` structure must remain backward-compatible within minor versions  
- Breaking changes will increment the major version  
- Documentation will always reference the YAML version it corresponds to

Current schema version:
**`MIPractice_case_v2.0_full_with_model_reference`**
