# MIPractice_case – full schema for praxeological anthropology / IA-based analysis (with integrated model_reference)
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Combined case template (MIPractice_case) and model reference (model_reference) for praxeological maturity analysis.
#   - `model_reference` defines the normative IA model: parameters (A, C, R, P, D), 2.4 submodule matrix,
#     guardrails, modulators, biases, scoring logic, etc.
#   - `case` is the structured template to document a FULL analysis with the IA model:
#     - A–C–R–P–D profile
#     - A- and M-band
#     - IA box (T–J–TB–R)
#     - trajectory (incl. responsibility–viability range)
#     - optional D module (B.11)
#     - optional submodule profile (full 2.4 parameter matrix)
#     - frame_vs_variability block (frame vs. movable elements)
#     - ia_protection & transmission_check blocks (Schutz- & Reifeprüfung der Anwendung)
# discipline_profiles:
#   Define domain-specific activation sets for the same axiomatic core (D0, A–C–P–R, IA_box, dignity dimensions).
#   A discipline_profile determines:
#     - which modules are foregrounded,
#     - which typical questions are asked,
#     - and which function modes (description / diagnosis / normative / intervention / axiomatic) are primary.
#   The axioms do NOT change; only the lens and depth of application shifts.
#
# ONE-PAGE MENTAL MODEL (for humans & AI):
#   1. We never judge persons, only enactments in roles and structures.
#   2. A & M are always BANDS plus text, never hard truth.
#   3. The IA-box is a structural check (T/J/TB/R), not a moral verdict.
#   4. The D module is OPTIONAL and SCENIC; default = OFF.
#   5. Trajectories > labels: we care more about movement than about types.
#   6. Application zones (green/yellow/red) define where the model may be used, only with caution, or not at all.
#   7. Before any AI-supported analysis, clarify meta-settings (reflection mode, D-module, depth, output format)
#      via `agent_interface` or use its safe defaults and document them.

# DO:
#   - Make roles, norms, information basis and bias risks explicit.
#   - Prefer "here, in this role, at this time" over "is always".
#   - Use D to protect dignity, not to sanction or shame.
#   - Separate frame elements (hard constraints, protected goods) from variable elements (processes, communication).
#   - Document IA-protection measures (transparency, time-boundedness, reversibility, participation).
#
# DO NOT:
#   - Use scores as character labels or as HR-/selection weapon.
#   - Mix clinical diagnoses into the maturity reading.
#   - Publish individual D-readings in public media spaces.
#   - Use the model in red zones (clinical diagnostics, forensics, individual HR-decisions, child diagnostics, public pillory).
#
# TYPICAL MISUSE PATTERNS TO AVOID:
#   - Turning A/M into static personality labels ("she is a 3/10").
#   - Using D findings for public shaming, scapegoating or power games.
#   - Forcing every situation into the A–C–R–P–D grid even when it does not fit.
#   - Ignoring structural co-causes (system axiom) and blaming individuals only.
#   - Treating structural frame elements as if actors could have foreseen/changed them (unfairly high M).
#
# CORE RULES FOR THE MODEL:
#   - Always analyse ENACTMENTS, ROLES and STRUCTURES – NEVER the ontological value of persons.
#   - Ontological dignity (D0) is NEVER rated, withdrawn or compared.
#   - A- and M-scores must always be given as BANDS (ranges) with short justifications.
#   - In cases of extreme structural asymmetry (no foreseeability, no real alternatives),
#     individual M remains low; co-responsibility lies primarily with institutions/designers.
#   - The D module (B.11) is OPTIONAL and DEFAULT = OFF. It may only be activated if guardrails are met.
#   - D findings must stay SCENIC and CONTEXT-BOUND, never global labels about a person.
#   - Trauma / heavy clinical states: D is NOT used as a maturity indicator, at most as a strain signal.
#   - Misuse of the model (e.g. for shaming, scapegoating, power games) counts as its own IA/D finding.
#   - Biases, context modulators, and publicity levels must be made explicit to avoid distortions.
#   - Trajectories (e.g. ascending, descending, zigzag, plateau) matter more than fixed labels.
#
# ANTHROPOLOGICAL PREMISE (non-axiomatic):
#   - Praxeological dignity (D1/D2) presupposes human cognitive and social capacities
#     (self-relation, role distinction, anticipation of effects, norm-sensitivity).
#   - Ontological dignity (D0) remains unconditional and independent of performance:
#     D0 is not derived from D1/D2, but becomes practically relevant in beings capable
#     of praxeological dignity.
#
# APPLICATION ZONES (GREEN / YELLOW / RED):
#   - Green: recommended – structures, historical/fictional cases, self-application; no direkte Individual-Sanktionen.
#   - Yellow: caution – cases with Betroffenen, nur eingebettet in Supervision/Moderation, ohne direkte personal decisions.
#   - Red: forbidden – clinical diagnostics, forensics, individual HR, child diagnostics, public pillory/ranking.
#
# FRAME VS. VARIABILITY:
#   - Always distinguish frame elements (laws, protected goods, hard constraints) from variable elements (roles, processes,
#     communication, timing).
#   - Mark zones where high M would be unfair, and where "system" is misused as excuse to avoid responsibility.
#
# IA-PROTECTION & TRANSMISSION:
#   - IA_protection documents what is done to make the asymmetry transparent, time-bound, reversible and participatory.
#   - transmission_check flags whether a reading is ripe for structural decision-making or must remain purely reflective.
#
# TOOLBOX, NOT WORLDVIEW:
# - Treat the model as a toolbox and lens, not as a total worldview.
# - Not every aspect of a situation must or can be forced into the A–C–R–P–D grid.
# - The model is substantively neutral (no party, no ideology); it cares about enactments, not slogans.
#
# MATURITY ≠ PURITY:
# - People are never fully adult; inadult zones (impulsive, rebellious, vulnerable) are normal and can be creative energy.
# - Maturity in practice = creating and holding adult zones AND containing/ integrating inadult zones under real conditions,
#   not eliminating all inadult patterns.
#
# TRAGEDY CLAUSE:
# - Not all painful outcomes are caused by inadult asymmetries. Some conflicts are tragic collisions of goods where
#   every option harms something. Do not automatically label tragedy as IA.
#
# PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL & SELF-IMPLICATION:
# - Psychological reading is strictly performative: describe maturity in behaviour, no clinical diagnosis, no speculation
#   about inner states without observable indicators, no pathologising labels.
# - Every analysis is itself an A–C–R–P–D enactment: analysts (and the AI) are never "outside" the model. Their own
#   use of power, language, and publicity must follow the same guardrails.
#
# GUARDRAILS SUMMARY (IMPLEMENTED IN FIELDS BELOW):
#   - Focus on structures, roles and enactments; profile ≠ person.
#   - Entry condition: minimal adulthood for actors assessed.
#   - Analyst self-implication is explicitly acknowledged.
#   - Information basis is documented (what is material, what is inference).
#   - Dignity guardrail: D0 untouched; D only in practice (D1/D2 via D-I/D-B/D-R/D-P), never on person value.
#   - D default off; activation requires explicit checklist, red-zone check and communication space selection.
#   - Trauma/neurodiversity: if heavy state present, D only as strain signal at most.
#   - Language hygiene for risk/danger/harm/potential and for D-related formulations.
#   - Public communication of D findings bound to spaces, with red zones flagged.
#
# INTENDED USE BY AN AI SYSTEM:
#   - Treat `model_reference` as the normative description of the IA model (parameters + 2.4 matrix + guardrails).
#     Do NOT alter these definitions; use them as the conceptual grid for all case readings.
#   - Fill `information_basis` from the given input (primary text/materials, other documents)
#     and your own explicit assumptions/inferences.
#   - BEFORE starting the analysis, use `agent_interface`:
#       * If the prompt explicitly specifies reflection mode, D-module use, analysis depth or output format,
#         honour those settings.
#       * If not specified and `pre_analysis_questions.* == true`, briefly ask the user:
#           - reflection_mode? (on/off)
#           - D-module? (auto/on/off) within guardrails
#           - analysis_mode? (ultra_short/short/full)
#           - output_format? (text/yaml)
#       * If the user does not answer, declines, or in non-interactive use, fall back to
#         `agent_interface.defaults` and document the chosen values under `case.meta.interaction_profile`.
#   - Set `meta.application_zone` and check that the planned use is in green or (carefully) yellow; never operate in red.
#   - Use `frame_vs_variability` to separate structural frame from changeable elements and to locate unfair M-attributions.
#   - Document IA-protection in `ia_protection` (transparency, time-boundedness, reversibility, participation).
#   - Use `scores_and_ia`, `acrpd_profile` and `acrpd_submodules_profile` for structured readings; keep bands and text together.
#   - Use `transmission_check` to decide whether a reading is only reflective or can inform structural decisions.
#   - If important information is missing or uncertain, mark it under `open_questions_and_blind_spots`.
#   - Generate `uniform_report` ONLY from the structured fields (B.10 / B.11), not from new hidden assumptions.
